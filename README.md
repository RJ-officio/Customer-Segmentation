# Personality Traits Analysis among Social Media Influencers with LSTM

        The idea of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model that detects the emotions that underlie a tweet. It makes associations between words and emotions and the aim is to classify the tweets into sentiments like anger, happiness, sadness, enthusiasm etc. rather than the usual sentiment classification that only involves truly contrasting sentiments of Positive and Negative.

## The Data:
        The data can be downloaded from tweetdata.csv
The data is in tabular form and each row is divided into 4 columns namely the tweet_id, sentiment, author and content.
The tweets in the data are pulled from Twitter using Twitter API as additional training data. The tweets are classified with their own hashtags — for example “#happy” as the hashtags should be an appreciably good (but far from perfect) representation of the sentiment of the tweet.
