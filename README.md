# Personality Traits Analysis among Social Media Influencers with LSTM

The idea of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model that detects the emotions that underlie a tweet. It makes associations between words and emotions and the aim is to classify the tweets into sentiments like anger, happiness, sadness, enthusiasm etc. rather than the usual sentiment classification that only involves truly contrasting sentiments of Positive and Negative.
